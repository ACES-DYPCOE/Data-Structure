# Strings

## Definition: String is a sequence of characters which is represented within double Quotes.

## String Library <cstring>
**cstring library** provides functions for string operations. 

1. **strxfrm()**- Transforms a given null terminated byte string into an implementation defined form.
2. **strcoll()**- Compares two null terminating string.
3. **strlen()**- returns the length of the given string.
4. **strerror()**- returns the textual description of the system error code.
5. **memset()**- copies a single character for a specified number of time to an object.
6. **strtok()**- returns the next token in a null terminated byte string.
7. **strstr()**- finds the first occurrence of a substring in a string.
8. **strspn()**- takes two string dest and src and gives the length of maximum initial segment of the string dest that consists of characters that are present in the string src. 
9. **strrchr()**- searches for the last occurrence of a character in a string.
10. **strpbrk()**- searches for a set of characters present in a string in another string.
11. **strcspn()**- takes two null terminated byte string: dest and src as its argument and searches dest for any characters that is present in src.
12. **strchr()**- searches for the first occurrence of a character in a string.
13. **memchr()**- searches for the first occurrence of a character in a specified number of characters.
14. **strncmp()**- compares a specified number of characters of two null terminating strings. The comparison is done lexicographically.
15. **strcmp()**- compares two null terminating string.
16. **memcmp()**- compares a specified number of characters of two pointer objects
17. **strncat()**- appends a specified number of characters of a string to the end of another string.
18. **strcat()**- appends a copy of a string to the end of another string.
19. **strncpy()**- copies a specified bytes of characters from source to destination.
20. **strcpy()**- copies a character string from source to destination.
21. **memmove()**- specified bytes of data from source to the destination.
22. **memcpy()**- copies a specified bytes of data from source to the destination.
