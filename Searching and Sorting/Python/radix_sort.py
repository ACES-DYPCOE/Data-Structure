#Radix sort processes the elements the same way in which the names of the students are sorted according to their alphabetical order.
#There are 26 radix in that case due to the fact that, there are 26 alphabets in English. In the first pass, the names are grouped
#according to the ascending order of the first letter of names.
#In the second pass, the names are grouped according to the ascending order of the second letter. The same process continues until we
#find the sorted list of names. The bucket are used to store the names produced in each pass. The number of passes depends upon the
#length of the name with the maximum letter.
#In the case of integers, radix sort sorts the numbers according to their digits.
#The comparisons are made among the digits of the number from LSB to MSB.
#The number of passes depend upon the length of the number with the most number of digits.
